# Update Analogue Pocket Shortcut
A Shortcut that can tell you if you need to update your Analogue Pocket.

For this shortcut to work, you need to create a list in reminders called: "Pocket" and create a reminder named: "0". Make sure that there is no completed reminders in the list.
The reason that the shortcut is named “Analog” instead of “Analogue” is because if you use this shortcut with Siri, it will think you said “Analog” not “Analogue”.
